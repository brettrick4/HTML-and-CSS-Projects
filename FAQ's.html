   <header><h2>What do you want to know about me?</h2>
    </header>
   <body><p><h3>I was born on October the fourth, ninteen humdred and seventy nine. That makes me a Libra, commonly known as the <strong>best</strong> astrological sign. This is because it is the only one not affiliated with an animal. I am five feet eleven inches tall, and, lets just say I am less than two hundred pounds. Not that much less, but I digress. I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach, and I am engaged to a wonderful woman, so sorry to all the single ladies out there.</p> <p>What else could you possibly be interested in? I have a sister, three years younger than me. I don't have a job, nor any money to spend. Broke but rich in spirit, that's me!</p></h3>
